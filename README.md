# JeffBot

This bot is named JeffBot after Jeff Williams, Apple's current COO. The bot was made with very large contributions from Moo#2899 and Blue#2222, who patiently guided me through the process, and helped me understand discord.py further.

This bot requires: 

-discord.py module (non-rewrite)
-Python 3.6 (not compatible with 3.7)


This bot does a few things:

- A simple command to text phrase process
- A varied set of commands for informing users about new iOS releases, beta or otherwise
- Adding roles to users upon running a command

I hope this code inspires you or helps you solve any issues you may be having! Contact me on discord if you have any questions: @23 Aaron#7547
